## how to use

1. downlod the `.js` file of the desired project, and upload it to your neocities.
    > ex: for the `lastupdated` project, download [`lastupdated.js`](/projects/lastupdated/lastupdated.js). i suggest keeping your `.js` files in a folder called `js` for organization!

2. edit the file, following the instructions in the project's related `readme.md`.
    > ex: refer to lastupdated's [`readme.md`](/projects/lastupdated/readme.md). every project has its own `readme.md`, this is for the sake of easy navigation on github.

3. add the script to your html file[s]
    ```html
    <!-- using the example project and tip: -->
    <script type="module" src="js/lastupdated.js"></script>
    ```
    > remember to place the script line in the `<head>` element of each html file you want to use the script!

*please note: be sure to double check your `<script>` element's `src` attribute. `"js/lastupdated.js"` is not custom fit to everyone. to learn more about relative paths, [click here](https://www.w3schools.com/Html/html_filepaths.asp).


## resources

i highly recommend learning about [relative paths](https://www.w3schools.com/Html/html_filepaths.asp) and [javascript data types and syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp), however it is not required.

further, my setup guides assume you know the basics of html and css. if you do not, [do your homework](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp).

*all of the above links are to w3schools tutorials and walkthroughs. they're very approachable for beginners, and i highly recommend.

## license
