    <p>this is my example page. unfortunately this module will not work for sites that aren't hosted by neocities. i can't tell you when <em>this</em> html file was last altered...</p>

    <!-- timestamp will be inserted in the <span> within the <p>, as that span has the id "last-updated" -->
    <p>but i CAN tell you that <a href="https://wormboy3.neocities.org">wormboy3</a> was last updated on <span id="last-updated">[timestamp loading...]</span>!</p>
